Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student supervised by [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/) in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo starting from 2020. My research interests are dense retrieval for text search and its application to conversational search. 

My research philosophy is
